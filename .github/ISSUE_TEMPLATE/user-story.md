### Notes

*You can add here some details about the user story that do not fit in the short title, associated non-functional requirements, etc.*
- note 1
- note 2

### User interface mockups

*Add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockup or draft, if applicable (see also slides of theoretical classes).*

### Acceptance tests

*For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)), i.e., a description of scenarios (situations) that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed by the user story (see also slides of theoretical classes).*

```gherkin
Feature: < feature name >
  As a _
  I want _
  So that _
  
  Background: < background name >
    Given _
    And _
    ...
  
  Scenario: < scenario1 name >
    Given _
    When _
    Then _
  
  ...
```

### Value and effort

*Add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method) and the team should add an estimation of the effort to implement it, for example, using t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL).*
