### Retrospectives

#### What went well

- Delivers a good UI proof of concept.
- The implemented tasks have no bugs and work properly.
- Good adaptation to the Flutter framework.
- Good adaptation to the original codebase.
- Good group dynamic, communication and teamwork.

#### What went poorly

- The number of incomplete tasks in the iteration backlog was high compared to the number of completed tasks.
- Late start of the work on the iteration.

#### Obstacles along the way

- The last week of the iteration coincided with the week of Queima das Fitas, which reduced the time the team had to work on the project.
- Two group members got infected with COVID-19 around the end of the iteration.
- Conflicting information about the end date of the iteration (information on moodle says the end is after the actual deadline; this update was poorly communicated and confused the team members).
