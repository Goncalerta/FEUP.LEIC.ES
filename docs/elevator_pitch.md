# Elevator Pitch

We’re the team behind SASS and, as university students ourselves, know first-hand how stressful and time-consuming it can be to apply for the semester’s class schedule. For such an important task, we offer a tailor-made solution: a scheduling assistant you can use straight from the UNI app on your phone which values your precious time and helps you plan out the schedule that’s right for you. Our mission is to provide the most streamlined, intuitive and personalized experience for scheduling your semester's classes. SASS helps you pick the schedules that fit your needs, without the hassle of navigating SIGARRA and evaluating all the possible combinations by yourself. This way, you can focus on what's really important — planning, tweaking and submitting schedule proposals instantly, just the way you want.
